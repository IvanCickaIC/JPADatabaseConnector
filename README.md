## Technologies Used
- **Java 1.8**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **EclipseLink 2.7.11**: A JPA (Java Persistence API) implementation used for managing database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL Driver**: A JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver that allows the Java application to connect and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Jersey JAX-RS**: A framework that simplifies the development of RESTful web services in Java.

## Project Overview

This project involved developing a comprehensive application for managing final theses at a university level. It was divided into two main parts:

### Backend Development

- **Implemented a Java application using JPA for database interactions.**
- **Managed entities such as Student, Teacher, and Thesis with appropriate attributes and relationships.**
- **Ensured CRUD operations on all entities through well-defined Java methods.**
- **Configured the project to work with PostgreSQL, with seamless integration and data persistence.**

### REST API Implementation

- **Extended the backend to publish REST APIs according to the OpenAPI 3 specifications.**
- **Used Jersey JAX-RS for creating and managing HTTP endpoints.**
